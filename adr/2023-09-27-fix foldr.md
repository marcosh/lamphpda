# Fix foldr

## Context

Currently foldr for `ListL` is implemented with a simple `foreach` loop. But that is actually equivalent to `foldl`.

## Decision

We change the implementation to use recursion instead of a `foreach`` to achieve the correct behavior of `foldr`.

## Consequences

The incorrect implementation of `foldr` made me to swap the order of the arguments in the `ConcatenationMonoid` for `ListL`. With this change, now the `append` operation can become more natural preserving the order of the arguments.
